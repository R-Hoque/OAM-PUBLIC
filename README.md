Open Aid Map
============

Public Repo for the Open Aid Map application. 

This application is tightly coupled with its companion database which can be found here:
https://github.com/spatialdev/PMT

You are welcome to download, fork, change and re-publish this application as your own. 
The OAM applicaiton itself is highly dependent on the underlying data model and its associated
functions. A correctly installed and configured database is required as are IATI formatted 
data which can be generated here: http://csv2iati.iatistandard.org/


In order for data to show up on the map, you must have the mininium data fields including:
Project Title
5-Digit IATI Sector codes for each activity
Funding Organiation for each activity
