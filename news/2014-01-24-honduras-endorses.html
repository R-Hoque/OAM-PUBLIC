<div class="snippet">
On October 31 2013, the Secretary of State from the Technical Planning and External Cooperation Secretariat Julio Raudales informed the World Bank Group of the Government's interest in implementing the Open Aid Partnership (OAP) mapping platform for Honduras. Honduras is the first country in Central America and	the second in Latin America to endorse the OAP. This partnership constitutes an important step in enhancing the transparency of the country's development projects because it will provide widespread access to the Honduras management platform. With this endorsement, the Government of Honduras will reinforce its ongoing Open Government agenda.
