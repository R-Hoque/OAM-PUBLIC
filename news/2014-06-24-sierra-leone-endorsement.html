On May 15, Sierra Leone became the <a href="http://openaidmap.org/" target="_blank">Open Aid Partnership’s (OAP)</a> newest country partner after the Minister of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED), Dr. Kaifala Marah, formally endorsed the Open Aid Partnership and its principles. The Minister requested the OAP’s assistance in furthering the Ministry’s efforts to enhance development data and build capacity of local stakeholders to use the data.<br /><br />
Following this endorsement, members of the OAP, hosted in the World Bank Group, organized a workshop on geo-referencing development projects in Freetown during May 21 to 27 as an initial step in the collaboration with MoFED. This means the Government, with support from the OAP, will be collecting and publishing information on where development projects are taking place within Sierra Leone at a very local level.<br /><br />
<b>Aid Data and Transparency in Sierra Leone</b><br /><br />
MoFED has already taken important strides towards improving and opening up data on development projects through its <a href="http://dad.synisys.com/dadsierraleone/" target="_blank">Development Assistance Database</a>, managed by the Development Assistance Coordination Office of MoFED. The DAD publishes detailed information on development projects, including donor agencies, dates of implementation, funding amounts and project objectives.<br /><br />
One thing development partners, Government and the general public want to know is: where are these projects taking place at the local level? Which chiefdoms and communities are receiving projects in which sectors, and which chiefdoms are being neglected? How many development partners are funding operations in vulnerable areas of the country, and how can they better coordinate their activities to enhance project results?<br /><br />
The OAP is supporting MoFED to collect and publish sub-national location information on development projects in Sierra Leone. Once the data have been collected, they will be visualized on mapping platforms, including the OAP’s <a href="http://openaidmap.org" target="_blank">Open Aid Map</a> and published on Government websites. The expectation is that collecting and publishing this information will help to improve project planning, donor coordination and engage Sierra Leoneans in the development activities taking place around them.<br />
