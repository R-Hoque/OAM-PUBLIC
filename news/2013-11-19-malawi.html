On October 29, the Malawi Government hosted a workshop to engage stakeholders in using open data for evidence-based policy, with support from the Open Aid Partnership, World Bank and UNDP. More than 70 representatives from government, development partners, civil society and the media came together to raise awareness and promote the use of Malawiâ€™s open data for development planning, coordination and citizen engagement. During the workshop, the Government launched its Aid Management Platform, a system built by Development Gateway, making detailed information on development programs fully open to the public for the first time.
