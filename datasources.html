	<p>The Open Aid Map captures and visualizes development assistance data as reported by Governments through country aid information management systems and as reported by donors. Geocoded development projects reported by donors are derived from the IATI registry and open data portals of each development agency. Poverty, demographic, and other development indicators are based on reliable, public information gathered from national statistical offices, government ministries, and international organizations, agencies and programs, such as the World Bank, WHO and Measure DHS.</p>
